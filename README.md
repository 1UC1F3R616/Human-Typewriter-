### Some Points
- Developed in NodeJS Express
- Currently a highly trending project
- Difficulty: Very Basic if working with Scripts
- Challenging: Dealing with server | Many loop holes

### Ideation
- This project Idea was given by [Yash Kumar Verma](https://gist.github.com/YashKumarVerma) and before this this technique wasn't used for generating human handwriting

### Future Scope
- I belive a better dataset is what I am writing next!
- Planned around 40+ Features to be added
- Yes! It needs a massive improvement in many number of ways
